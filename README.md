# Weather-Application-and-Warning-Device
IoT Based Node-Red Dashboard with ESP8266 Warning signal
There are two parts of this project. In the first part, the objective is to design a dashboard to get a full weather update of user input location. The second part objective is to give a warning signal from ESP 8266, when there is a warning condition on the weather. We implemented a dashboard in Node-Red and we used open-source API(Openweather) as our data source. To get a warning signal from ESP 8266, we use the MQTT broker to send data to the Arduino platform from Node-Red. Any user can get updates on the weather conditions anywhere in the world.
